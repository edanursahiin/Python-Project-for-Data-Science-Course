# Python-Project-for-Data-Science-Course

This is a project for a data science course on Coursera.


This project involves acting as a Data Scientist for a startup investment firm, tasked with gathering financial data on popular stocks like Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. Using Python libraries and web scraping techniques, historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports are collected from various sources. The collected data is then visualized in a dashboard to identify trends and patterns. The project utilizes Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio, offering a hands-on environment for learning and project development. Additionally, the lab involves extracting stock data using the yfinance library to analyze suspicious stock activities for a hedge fund.
